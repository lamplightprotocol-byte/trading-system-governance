1) Read the Blueprint chapters 1–3 (foundation)

3) Log one change → run one test → record PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE

## FAQ

**Is this executable code?** No. Templates/schemas/examples only (non-executable).  
**Do you provide a strategy or signals?** No.  
**Does PF 0.72 mean I’ll get that performance?** No — it’s a reality filter case study, not a performance claim.
