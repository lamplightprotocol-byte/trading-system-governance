# Trading System Governance (Evidence-Based)

Built to enforce one-change-per-run, evidence gates, and traceable decisions—so you stop “one more tweak” iterations.

Evidence-based governance workflow for systematic trading R&D: change proposals, experiment logs, release/rollback discipline.

**Not a bot. Not signals. Not executable trading code.**

## What LEP is (and is NOT)

**LEP v1 is a self-serve governance framework** for systematic traders and developers building trading systems.  
It helps you run disciplined iteration with **one-change-per-run**, evidence gates (**PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE**), and a traceable decision trail.

**LEP is NOT:**
- a trading strategy
- a signal service
- runnable trading code
- a promise of profitability
